# The basics of Move

The Move language is a programming language designed specifically for the Diem (formerly Libra) blockchain, a Facebook initiative in the field of cryptocurrencies. Today, the Diem project no longer exists, which is why the Move language is now used for the Aptos blockchain.

This language stands out for its focus on security and integrity in the handling of digital assets, which is crucial in blockchain applications. Unlike other blockchain programming languages such as Solidity for Ethereum, Move allows developers to define custom resource types, ensuring that these resources can neither be duplicated nor accidentally destroyed.
