# Basic Function in Move

Function is the only place of execution in Move. Function starts with the `fun` keyword which is followed by function name, parentheses () for arguments and curly braces {} for body.


```move
fun <function_name>(<Parameters if any>) {
// function body
}
```

Here `fun` keyword is used to declare a function in Move, let's see how to add some arguments as a part of the function,
```move
fun test(arg1: u64, arg2: 64) {
// function body
}
```

Here `arg1` of type `u64` and `arg1` of type `u64` are the two parameters declared as a part of the function.


ðŸ¤” You might have noticed the variable `house` is written as `_house` . Do you know why?

**Note:** While you try to compile the newly created function you will recieve a warning saying `Unused assignment or binding for local 'house'. Consider removing, replacing with '_', or prefixing with '_' (e.g., '_house')` 

Concept : Using `_` acknowledges that the variable is intentionally not being used. We will talk more about this in the later chapter once we start dealing with local variables.

Let us play around with the function a little more, create a function named `init_house` with parameters to initialise the house struct. We will cover signers in detail shortly.
