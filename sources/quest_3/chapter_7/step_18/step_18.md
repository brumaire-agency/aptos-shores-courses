### Understanding Abort in Move

The Abort mechanism in Move is a powerful feature that allows safe termination of execution and reverting state changes. Here are some key points:

- **Explicit Trigger:** Abort can be triggered explicitly using the `abort` instruction. This instruction takes an error code as an argument.
- **Runtime Errors:** Certain runtime errors, such as index out of bounds, can also trigger an abort. These errors occur automatically during execution.
- **State Reversion:** When an abort occurs, any changes made to the global state are reverted. This ensures that the transaction fails, and the state remains consistent.
- **Error Code:** The error code provided in the abort instruction is surfaced to the client or caller as a transaction error. This allows for more detailed error handling.
- **Preventing Invalid State:** Abort is a crucial tool for preventing invalid or undesirable states from being persisted in the blockchain.


#### Example: Explicit Abort

```move
fun div (num1: u64, num2: u64){
    if (num1 == 0 || num2 == 0)
    abort 0 ;
    let divide = a/b;
   
}
```
In this example 
- The function `div` takes two input `num1` and `num2` of type `u64`.
- It checks whether any of these inputs has value 0, it will abort the excution with error code 0. 
- If it does not abort it will move to the next line of execution and perform the division operation.

It is time for you to decide whether to abort the learning process or not. Oh wait! that option does not exist ðŸ˜‚ So go experiment with what you just learned right now. Create a function `add_member` which takes a parameter `h` for mutable reference to the struct `House` in the fucntion body write the code to check the condition if `no_of_members >= 4` the execution will abort with code `0` else it will increment the `no_of_members` by 1.
