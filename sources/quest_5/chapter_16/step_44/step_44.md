### Understanding `init_module` Function

The `init_module` function is pivotal in initializing our NFT module during deployment. Let's dissect its functionality:

#### Function Declaration and Resource Account Creation for Token Signer Capability:

```move
fun init_module(account: &signer) {
    let (token_resource, token_signer_cap) = account::create_resource_account(
        account,
        APP_SIGNER_CAPABILITY_SEED,
    );
    // ...
}
```
- The function declaration defines `init_module` with a parameter `account` of type `&signer`, representing the account deploying the module.
- `account::create_resource_account` is called to create a resource account for the token signer capability, using the deployment `account` and `APP_SIGNER_CAPABILITY_SEED`.
- It returns a tuple containing the resource account `token_resource` and the signer capability `token_signer_cap`.

#### Resource Account Creation for Burn Signer Capability:

```move
let (_, burn_signer_capability) = account::create_resource_account(
    account,
    BURN_SIGNER_CAPABILITY_SEED,
);
```
- Another resource account is created for the burn signer capability using `account::create_resource_account` with the deployment `account` and `BURN_SIGNER_CAPABILITY_SEED`.
- The resulting resource account is ignored, and only the burn signer capability `burn_signer_capability` is retained.

#### Moving `CollectionCapability` Struct to Deployer's Account Storage:

```move
move_to(account, CollectionCapability {
    capability: token_signer_cap,
    burn_signer_capability,
});
```
- The `CollectionCapability` struct is instantiated with the token signer capability `token_signer_cap` and burn signer capability `burn_signer_capability`.
- `move_to` function is used to move the `CollectionCapability` struct to the deployer's account storage.

#### Moving `MintInfo` Struct to Deployer's Account Storage:

```move
move_to(account, MintInfo{
    count: 0,
});
```
- The `MintInfo` struct is instantiated with an initial count of 0, representing the minting count.
- `move_to` function moves the `MintInfo` struct to the deployer's account storage.

#### Creating the Token Collection:

```move
create_collection(&token_resource);
```
- The `create_collection` function is invoked with `token_resource` as an argument.
- This function creates the token collection using the `token_resource` account.
Note: In Move, the underscore `_` is used as a wildcard pattern to ignore or discard values that are not needed. It is commonly used when destructuring tuples or in function parameters to indicate that a particular value is not used within the scope. By convention, using `_` signifies that the value is intentionally being ignored and is not relevant to the current context.


---
Oh this was indeed a long lesson. You deserve a break after this one so let's quickly wrap up all the tasks. Define a function `init_module` that takes a `&signer` as input inside the function create a resource account using `account::create_resource_account` with `account` as the signer and `APP_SIGNER_CAPABILITY_SEED` as the seed and store the the returned tuple value into `token_resource` and `token_signer_cap`. Create another resource account using `account::create_resource_account` with `account` as the signer and `BURN_SIGNER_CAPABILITY_SEED` as the seed and store the returned tuple into a throwaway variable (`_`) and `burn_signer_capability`. Then using the `move_to` move the `CollectionCapability` struct with fields `capability` and `burn_signer_capability` to the `account` signer's storage, next move the `MintInfo` struct with field `count` initialized to `0` to the `account` signer's storage. And finally the last task call the `create_collection` function with `&token_resource` as an argument. Taddaaaaa! a pat on your back for completing one of the most difficult lesson of this quest. See you in the next one!
